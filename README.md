# Introduction to Robotics (2023-2024)

This repository showcases my journey through the Introduction to Robotics laboratory, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each step I took is represented by the homework I uploaded here, including requirements, implementation details, code, and even photos and videos.

## Homework-1 
Description:

This first mission consists of the implementation of a circuit made up of an RGB LED and three potentiometers. We will use the three potentiometers and the Arduino board to control the light intensity of each channel of the RGB LED. The RGB LED has 4 pins, 3 for colors and one for ground. The required voltages for the red pin is 2.0 V, for the green one is 3.2 V and for the blue one is 3.1 V. We also used three resistors, two of 330 Ohm and one of 220 Ohm. A potentiometer has 3 pins, 2 of them are called fixed and are for power and ground, respectively. The other pin is called variable and we use it to change the luminous intensity of the LED.

Used components:

  • one RGB LED
  
  • three Potentiometers
  
  • resistors and wires as needed
